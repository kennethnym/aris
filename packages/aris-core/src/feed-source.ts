/**
 * Unified interface for sources that provide context, feed items, and actions.
 *
 * Sources form a dependency graph — a source declares which other sources
 * it depends on, and the graph ensures dependencies are resolved before
 * dependents run.
 *
 * Source IDs use reverse domain notation. Built-in sources use `aris.<name>`,
 * third parties use their own domain (e.g., `com.spotify`).
 *
 * Every method maps to a protocol operation for remote source support:
 * - `id`, `dependencies`       → source/describe
 * - `listActions()`            → source/listActions
 * - `executeAction()`          → source/executeAction
 * - `fetchContext()`           → source/fetchContext
 * - `fetchItems()`             → source/fetchItems
 * - `onContextUpdate()`        → source/contextUpdated (notification)
 * - `onItemsUpdate()`          → source/itemsUpdated (notification)
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const locationSource: FeedSource = {
 *   id: "aris.location",
 *   async listActions() { return { "update-location": { id: "update-location" } } },
 *   async executeAction(actionId) { throw new UnknownActionError(actionId) },
 *   async fetchContext() { ... },
 * }
 * ```
